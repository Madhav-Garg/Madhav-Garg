# Hey! What's up, guys?

I'm Madhav Garg, a full-stack web developer who loves building clean, responsive, and useful applications. Currently working with core technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and building dynamic apps using React and Node.js.

I enjoy writing code that not only works — but makes sense. Whether it's structuring frontend components or setting up backend APIs, I like keeping things organized and efficient.
