# Hey, what's up guys

I'm Madhav Garg — a web developer who builds real-world, clean, and useful stuff on the internet.  
Currently focused on full-stack development using modern tools and frameworks.

Right now, I'm building projects using:

- HTML & CSS for clean layouts  
- JavaScript & React for dynamic UIs  
- Node.js for backend APIs  
- SQL & MongoDB for structured and flexible data  

I like working on things that solve actual problems, not just practice projects. My focus is always on writing code that’s readable, efficient, and scalable.
